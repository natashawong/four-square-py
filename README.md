# Connect Four in Python
"Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid."

In this version of Connect Four, players have the option of 2 game modes:
1. Playing against another human player
2. Playing against an AI robot

In both game modes, a scoreboard is displayed to keep track of the respective players scores!

How the AI bot works:
* If there is a chance to make a winning move – the AI will make a winning move
* If there is a chance to block the player from winning – the AI will block the player
* Otherwise, the AI will pick a legal move
